Project created by Ndangoh joseph suh

This project is aimed at building a chat application using the ionic framework.

The apllication basically searches for other users on the same netwotk who are
are users of wichat. 

When users are found, a request for P2P connection with a user can be made.
Upon accetance, the two users can exchange;
1- Tesxt messages
2- Files(png, jpeg, pdf, word)
3- Adio calls
4- Video call

This application uses the cordova service libraries for camera, earphone etv 
to enhance the functionlalities of the application.

Communication using the wichat application does not require internet connections.
